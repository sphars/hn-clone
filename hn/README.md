# Hacker News Clone
A simple application utilizing the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Yeah, kind of looks like the main [Hacker News site](https://news.ycombinator.com), but that will change as progress is made.  

Goal is practice using JavaScript and APIs. 

## To-Do and Wishlist:
* Dark theme toggle (it's all the rage)
* Load comments
* Scroll to top of page
* Load more stories on scroll down
* Better styles?
