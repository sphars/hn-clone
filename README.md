# Hacker News Clone
A simple application utilizing the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Yeah, kind of looks and acts like the real [Hacker News site](https://news.ycombinator.com), but that will hopefully change as progress is made.  

Goal is to practice using JavaScript and APIs. 

## To-Do and Wishlist
Moved to [repo issues](https://github.com/spncrhrstn/hn-clone/issues).

### Disclaimer
I  make no claims that this frontend for HN is any better than the offical website. In fact, it's probably worse. This is simply an exercise in working with an API and practicing my JavaScript.
